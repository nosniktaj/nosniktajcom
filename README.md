# Nosniktaj.com

**Nosniktaj.com** is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my coding projects, GitHub contributions, and professional achievements. Although the website is still in its early stages with just a landing page, future features will include:

- **List of repositories** I contribute to on GitHub
- **View of commits** from my GitHub repositories (this will be imported and displayed dynamically)
- **Database integration** (a feature under development that will store and display dynamic content, such as project details, stats, or commit history)
- **Social Media Links** (links to my profiles on GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)

## Current Features

### Landing Page

- An introduction to who I am, what I do, and what technologies I work with.
- **Typewriter effect** to display my name or coding slogan.
- **Responsive design** to ensure the page looks good on mobile and desktop devices.

## Planned Features

1. **GitHub Repositories List**  
   Display a list of the repositories I contribute to, along with some basic information about each one (e.g., repo name, description, and link).

2. **Commit History View**  
   I plan to integrate GitHubâ€™s API to pull in recent commits and display them on my portfolio. This will allow visitors to see my activity in real-time.

3. **Database Integration**  
   This feature will be added in the future to dynamically store and display content like:
   - Project details (name, description, status)
   - GitHub contributions (commits, pull requests)
   - Blog posts or articles related to my work

4. **Social Media Links**  
   Links to my main social profiles for easy connection (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.).

5. **Blog Section** (optional)
   - I may incorporate a simple blog system to write about coding topics, tutorials, or thoughts on tech trends.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend (Planned)**: Node.js, Express (for API and data integration)
- **Database (Planned)**: MongoDB or MySQL (for storing project data, commits, and more)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
